# 🤝 Handshake and Combination Calculator (Java)

## 📘 Overview
This Java program performs two recursive calculations:
1. **Handshake Problem** – Calculates how many handshakes occur if everyone in a room shakes hands once with every other person.
2. **Combination (nCr)** – Computes the number of ways to choose `r` items from a set of `n` items using recursion.

## 🧮 Features
- Uses **recursion** for both the handshake and combination calculations.
- Demonstrates the relationship between recursion and combinatorial logic.
- Accepts user input via `Scanner`.

## 💡 How It Works

### 🤝 Handshake Function
The handshake problem is based on the formula:
Total handshakes = n * (n - 1) / 2
